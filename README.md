# JathLib
A vex V5 library with several features I felt were useful to have such as easy access PID, higher level motor control, odometry, and data recording. 

Features:
-Templates for TankDrives, X-Drives(and Mecanum Drives), H-Drives, and even Asterisk Drives
-Several Odometry Options based on different sensor configurations (only 2 right now)
-Path Following and macro support alongside a custom path creator and editor
-Data logging in CSV format
-Some math utilities such as a 2d-Vector class and functions to aid in converting angles

This Library works in either VexCode or the VexCode VSC extension. Originally, the files were sorted into different directories, but in order to import the files into VexCode pro all in one go, they needed to be stored in the same place.s 

Theres no real documentation yet, but I'll do something eventually. For now, examples and descriptions will have to suffice.
